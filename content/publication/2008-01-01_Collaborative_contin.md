abstract = "We present a methodology to engineer services in real-time information environments. We evaluate, combine and enrich traditional techniques and methodologies such as New Product Development and Adaptive Software Development in order to support the development and continuous improvement of information services. Our methodology is based upon the financial service environment. It is specific enough to be applicable in the field of finance and general enough to be applied broadly in information services development."
